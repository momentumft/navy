Feature: Launching and working with an navy from the CLI

  Scenario: Launch prompt when not specifying services to launch
    Given I am working with the test navy which hasn't been imported yet
    When I launch a service from the CLI prompt
    Then I should see that the service is running

  Scenario: Launch without prompt when specifying services to launch
    Given I am working with the test navy
    When I launch a service from the CLI directly
    Then I should see that the service is running
